Developed a deep learning-based model to classify chest X-ray images as either normal or showing signs of tuberculosis (TB). The system will preprocess and augment image data, train multiple deep learning models, and evaluate their performance. The final application will provide an interface for uploading X-ray images and receiving predictions
